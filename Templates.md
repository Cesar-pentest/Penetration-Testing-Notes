## Executive Summary

A high-level overview intended for management. Explain what was found and the overall risk in non-technical terms.

> A penetration test was conducted on the target machine `[Machine Name]`. The assessment revealed several critical vulnerabilities that allowed for a complete compromise of the system. The most significant issue was **[e.g., a misconfigured service allowing remote code execution]**. Successful exploitation led to unauthorized access and full control over the target. Immediate remediation of these findings is recommended.

## Technical Findings

### 1. Initial Foothold
**Vulnerability:** [Vulnerability Title, e.g., SQL Injection on Login Page] \
**CVSS Score:** [e.g., 9.0 (Critical)] \
**Attack Vector:** Network \
**Description:**
A brief description of the service and the vulnerability found.

**Evidence:**
*   **Command Output:**
    ```bash
    # Show the crucial enumeration command that led to the discovery.
    # FOR EXAMPLE: nmap -sV -sC 10.10.10.XXX
    # But NEVER show the final exploitation command or the flag.
    $ gobuster dir -u http://[IP]/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/common.txt
    ```
*   **Screenshot:** ![Gobuster Scan Findings](./screenshots/1_gobuster_scan.png)

**Remediation:**
*   [Recommendation 1, e.g., Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQLi.]
*   [Recommendation 2, e.g., Update the application to the latest version.]

### 2. Privilege Escalation: [User] to [root/System]
**Vulnerability:** [Title, e.g., Misconfigured SUID Binary] \
**CVSS Score:** [e.g., 7.5 (High)] \
**Attack Vector:** Local \
**Description:**
Description of how you escalated privileges internally.

**Evidence:**
*   **Enumeration Command:**
    ```bash
    # Show HOW you found the vector, not HOW you exploited it.
    # E.g.: find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
    ```
*   **Screenshot (Optional but recommended):** ![SUID Binaries Found](./screenshots/2_suid_find.png)
*   **Explanation:** "The binary `/usr/bin/[some_binary]` was found to have the SUID bit set. Research indicated this could be exploited to escalate privileges."

**Remediation:**
*   [Recommendation 1, e.g., Apply the principle of least privilege: remove the SUID bit from unnecessary binaries.]
*   [Recommendation 2, e.g., Use a tool like `auditd` to monitor for privilege escalation attempts.]

## Attack Chain Diagram
(OPTIONAL, but VERY impactful) Create a simple flow diagram showing the attack path. You can use [draw.io](https://draw.io) or excalidraw.

## Conclusion
The `[Machine Name]` machine was compromised due to [reason 1] and [reason 2]. The lack of [security control] allowed for a full chain of exploitation. It is crucial to address these issues to maintain a secure environment.

## Tools Used
*   **Reconnaissance:** `nmap`, `gobuster`
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** `searchsploit`, `manual testing`
*   **Exploitation:** `custom python script`, `metasploit`
*   **Post-Exploitation:** `linpeas`, `linux-smart-enumeration`
