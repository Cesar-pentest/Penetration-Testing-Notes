# 🔐 Penetration Testing Portfolio & HTB Writeups

Hello! I'm **César López Oliva**, an aspiring Penetration Tester specializing in vulnerability assessment and ethical hacking (eJPT certified, OSCP in progress).

This repository serves as a public archive of my learning journey and methodology for solving Hack The Box machines. The goal is to demonstrate my technical skills, thought process, and ability to document security findings clearly and professionally.

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   **`/Retired`**: Complete writeups for retired machines. These contain no spoilers for active boxes.
*   **`/Templates`**: The templates I use to maintain consistency and professionalism in my reports.

## 🧪 My Methodology

My approach follows a structured penetration testing methodology:
1.  **Reconnaissance:** Extensive enumeration using tools like `nmap`, `gobuster`, and `enum4linux`.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identifying potential attack vectors and security flaws.
3.  **Exploitation:** Gaining initial access, often by leveraging or modifying public exploits.
4.  **Post-Exploitation:** Privilege escalation and internal enumeration to understand the full scope of access.
5.  **Documentation:** Creating detailed reports with findings, evidence, and hardening recommendations.
